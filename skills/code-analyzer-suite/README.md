# Code Analyzer Suite

This repository contains two related skills:

- `code-analyzer-suite`: the original version, designed for structured multi-dimensional review with manual multi-window fallback.
- `code-analyzer-auto`: the auto-orchestration version, designed for runtimes that can dispatch sub-agents or worker threads automatically.

Use the original skill when you want explicit worker prompts or need to support older environments. Use the auto version when the runtime can orchestrate parallel workers directly.

## Skills In This Repo

### `code-analyzer-suite`

- Focused multi-dimensional review across Security, Performance, Code Quality, Architecture, and Logic Verification
- Structured findings-first output
- Manual or semi-manual parallel execution
- Good fit for environments where worker prompts must be visible and copy-pasteable

### `code-analyzer-auto`

- Automatic dispatch to sub-agents or worker threads when the runtime supports it
- Shared orchestration brief for all workers
- Consolidation-oriented output for orchestrator agents
- Manual fallback prompts only when automatic execution is unavailable
- Trigger boundary that keeps ordinary single-agent reviews on the original skill

## Features

- 5 analysis dimensions: Security, Performance, Code Quality, Architecture, Logic Verification
- Parallel review support for both automatic worker orchestration and manual multi-window execution
- Structured output with consistent severity ratings
- Language support for Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, Go, Rust, SQL, and more
- Consolidated reports that merge dimension results into one review

## Installation

### Quick Install

```bash
./install.sh
```

The quick installer targets the original `code-analyzer-suite`. Install `code-analyzer-auto` as a separate skill directory when your runtime supports auto-discovery of multiple skills.

### Install Auto Skill

```bash
cp -R code-analyzer-auto ~/.codex/skills/code-analyzer-auto
cp -R code-analyzer-auto ~/.agents/skills/code-analyzer-auto
```

Use the first path for Codex and the second path for universal agent runtimes. On Windows, copy `code-analyzer-auto` to the matching skills directory for your tool.
